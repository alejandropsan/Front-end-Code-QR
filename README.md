### What I learned

```css
.card-body .card-title {
    color: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
}

.card-body .card-description {
    color: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
}
```

I have learned and practiced this HSL color range based on a reference to hue, saturation and light.
It is another way to place colors. I knew them but had not studied them until now. And with this exercise I have taken the time to investigate them.

### Continued development

To continue advancing in front-end development it is very necessary for me to focus on complex animations with CSS.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.uifrommars.com/que-es-hsl/) - This article is a good introduction on how these colors are integrated and how they are formed and what they mean.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_hsl.asp) - This is the official guide where you can apply examples and configure all these colors to your liking. In addition to a detailed explanation of how these colors work in CSS.
- [Example resource 3](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modelo_de_color_HSL) - Here you can discover the history, characteristics, different formations explained by their corresponding mathematical formulas. Making comparisons with RGB along with its conversions etc...
